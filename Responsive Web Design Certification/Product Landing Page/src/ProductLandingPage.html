				<p>A girl band always searching for that sparkling, heart-pounding beat, based on Toyama Kasumi's (guitar and vocals) childhood observation of the stars shining in the night sky. The other four members are music-lover Hanazono Tae (lead guitar), shy but confident girl Ushigome Rimi (bass), kind and family-oriented Yamabuki Saaya (drums), and constant contrarian Ichigaya Arisa (keyboard). They have band practice in Arisa's basement, and what they lack in skill and experience, they more than make up for in enthusiasm.</p>

				<p>The group consists of five members, namely Mitake Ran (guitar and vocals), Aoba Moca (guitar), Uehara Himari (bass), Udagawa Tomoe (drums), and Hazawa Tsugumi (keyboard). A girl band made up of childhood friends. When Ran  moved to a different class, the girls made a band so they could still see each other. Now in high school, they love playing in their band, practicing after school and playing live shows. They get along famously and almost never fight. Though they're still fairly inexperienced, they gained popularity for their powerful performances and strong vocals. </p>

				<p>An idol band formed by a talent agency. The band is made up of Maruyama Aya (vocals), who has spent huge amounts of time training for her debut; celebrity and child actor Shirasagi Chisato (bass), and modeling sensation Wakamiya Eve (keyboard). They were later joined by Hikawa Hina (guitar), who passed the band's auditions and then studio musician Yamato Maya (drums). The five of them are using this experience to bolster their very own definition of an "idol" and what is it to be one.</p>

				<p>A highly talented band. With their skilled performances and pro-level vocals, they are a highly praised group. Minato Yukina (vocals) started the band with a special certain goal in mind. The other members are the like-minded Hikawa Sayo (guitar), childhood friend Imai Lisa (bass), youngest and most talented Udagawa Ako (drums), and the award-winning Shirokane Rinko (keyboard). They play at a well-known live house and hope someday to make it to the big time. </p>

				<p>Since the voice actresses of Afterglow, Pastel*Palettes or Hello, Happy World! are unable to play their characters' instrument, RAISE A SUILEN was created to allow the vocalists to have a chance to perform.
